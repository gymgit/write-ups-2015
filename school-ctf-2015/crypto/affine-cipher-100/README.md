**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 100

**Description:**

> Decrypt the message, which was encrypted with following rules:
>
>     for each letter of cipher text its position in the alphabet is the position of the original letter multiplied by 4 and shifted by 15 character
>
>     shift over alphabet is cyclic, so 'z' shifted by 1 is '_' and '_' shifted by 1 is 'a'
>
>     aplhabet consists of letters from 'a' to 'z' and symbol '_'
>
>     letter 'a' has position 0, symbol '_' has position 26 ( following 'z' )
