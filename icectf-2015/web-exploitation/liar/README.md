**Category:** Web Exploitation
**Points:** 30
**Description:** 

> We found this <a target='_blank' href='/problem-static/stage1/web/liar/liar.html'>site</a> which seems to just give you the flag. You wouldn't mind entering it for us, would you?

**Hint:**

> It's not as easy as it seems. Maybe the flag is hidden somewhere? Is it executable?
