# IceCTF 2015: Giffy

**Category:** Web Exploitation
**Points:** 60
**Description:** 

> A real hacker must have a good place to store his gifs! We found one such collection <a target='_blank' href='http://web2015.icec.tf/giffy/'>here</a>. Can you try to read <code>flag.txt</code>?

**Hint:**

> A <code>.txt</code> file isn't a GIF :( So why would it be in the same place?
