# IceCTF 2015: Entropy

**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 110
**Description:** 

> <p>We managed to get the flag, but it's encrypted! We found the keyserver that was used though, and stole its source. Could you figure out a way to decrypt the flag? You can get public keys from the keyserver with <code>nc vuln2015.icec.tf 30896</code>.</p><p>[server.py](./server.py) [flag.txt](./flag.txt)</p>

**Hint:**

> Maybe some keys are brother and sister!
