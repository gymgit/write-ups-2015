# Hack.lu CTF 2015: Champion

**Category:** Web
**Points:** 200
**Solves:** 6
**Description:**

> I'm the champion of jump and run, and I have a problem.
> After a quick look at this new game, I told everyone I could certainly play through it in under 5000 ticks. But now they expect me to do it, and in my first few attempts, I couldn't quite reach that. Normally, I would just send the highscore I should have gotten to the highscore server directly, but this game is doing something weird. Can you help me?
