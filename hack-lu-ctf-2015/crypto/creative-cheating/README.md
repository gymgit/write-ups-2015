**Points:** 150
**Solves:** 111
**Description:**

> Mr. Miller suspects that some of his students are cheating in an automated computer test. He [captured some traffic](dump_2bd6da8de87c6f1170dec710f7268a16.pcapng) between crypto nerds Alice and Bob. It looks mostly like garbage but maybe you can figure something out.
> He knows that Alice's RSA key is (n, e) = (0x53a121a11e36d7a84dde3f5d73cf, 0x10001) (192.168.0.13) and Bob's is (n, e) = (0x99122e61dc7bede74711185598c7, 0x10001) (192.168.0.37)
