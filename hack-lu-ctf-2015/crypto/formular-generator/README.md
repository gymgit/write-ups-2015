**Description:**

> It's grading time again. But the students didn't do that well this time. The teachers hand in the grades with a formular which has a random id and is signed by 5 numbers. One student managed to get parts of the source code of the program which is used to generate and sign these formulars. Can you fake a create a formular to hand in your grades on your own ?
