## Write-up

by [polym](https://github.com/abpolym)

We are given a sequence of dancing figures as ciphertext:

These dancing men originate from Arthur Conan Doyle's short story "The Adventure of the Dancing Men" [[1](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hasinoff/pubs/hasinoff-quipster-2003.pdf)], which gives us this key:

A flag in the hand of a stick figure means a word ends. However, we don't have these kind of stick figures.

Beginning at the first stick figure without a flag as `A`, we can translate the ciphertext.

The flag is `chincopachincopa`.
