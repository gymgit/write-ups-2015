## Write-up

by Fernando Mu√±oz

The challenge included a video file inside the ZIP.

This video file was generated using [Tempest for Windows](https://cryptome.org/2015/09/tempest-test-for-windows.htm) and it plays the Mario Bross theme.

The easiest way to solve it is using an AM radio and playing the video, you will hear the song through it.
