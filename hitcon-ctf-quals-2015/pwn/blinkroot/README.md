**Description:**

> Blinkroot is a common herb that grows randomly on Dirt or Mud blocks, regardless of lighting or elevation, so long as there is room for it to grow and the blocks bear no grass of any kind. It is most commonly found in the underground layer and below, due to the general lack of grass in those areas. It can be harvested with any weapon or tool. Blinkroot can be planted manually using Blinkroot Seeds, which can also be planted in Clay Pots.
