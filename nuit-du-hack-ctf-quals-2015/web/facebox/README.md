## Write-up

The first thing to figure out in this challenge, was that the website was running on the "production" server (hence the `prod` in the hostname). This then lead to discovering the development server (`.facebox.challs.nuitduhack.com/`), which contained a `.git/` folder.

After cloning the `.git/` folder, we found [a file](main.py) containing the method used to generate the random filename of uploaded files.
Basically, filenames were generated as follows: `md5(privkey + filename)` with `privkey` being a random value between 10000000 and 99999999, unique per user.

The first file uploaded to the service `confidentials.txt` private, i.e. we did not know the link. However, for the second file, we knew the original filename (`paste01.txt`) and the randomly generated filename (`3686d78a6e9d5258773a6ae0469d3ed4`). Bruteforcing the privkey for that user, we found the value was `95594864`.

Using this value, all we had to do is compute the "random" filename of the private file: `md5("95594864confidentials.txt")` â†’ `35e2cb0b2e8bd40347ecd4e32767a060`. This allowed us to [see the `confidentials.txt` file](http://prod.facebox.challs.nuitduhack.com/files/view/35e2cb0b2e8bd40347ecd4e32767a060), which contained the flag: `M4x_M4i5_DR`.
